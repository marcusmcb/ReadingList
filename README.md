# ReadingList

Welcome to the Reading List application!

With this application you can enter, save, and edit all of the books you have read (or plan to read) in a master list for later reference.

# Add Book Page

From this page you may add books to your reading list by entering the following:

- Book Title
- Author
- Total Page Count
- Current Pages Read
- Whether or not you have previously read this book

After clicking add book the information you've submitted will be entered into your master reading list.  

Once saved you have the option to either add another entry into your list or to view your current reading list.

# View Reading List

Upon clicking the "view reading list" option you will be taken to the list page which will display all of the entries currently in your master reading list, displaying the title, author, page count, pages read and whether or not you have previously read the book for each entry.

For each book in your reading list you are given two options:

# Edit This Book

This will allow you to make any updates you wish to a particular book entry.

# Delete This Book

This option will allow you to delete a book from your master reading list if you wish.
